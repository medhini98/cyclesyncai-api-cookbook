# CycleSyncAI: Personalized Health Plans Powered by Sonar API

## Overview

**CycleSyncAI** is an iOS app designed to provide personalized **diet and workout recommendations** tailored to a woman’s **menstrual cycle phase**.

By integrating menstrual data from Apple **HealthKit** and optional user profile inputs (age, weight, height, medical conditions, dietary restrictions, goals, and preferences), the app generates dynamic, phase-aware suggestions to support holistic wellness.

Unlike static wellness tools, **CycleSyncAI** leverages **Perplexity’s Sonar Pro API** to deliver **expert-informed**, LLM-generated guidance — including a daily grocery list and motivational feedback — customized to the user's cycle and lifestyle.

---

## Problem & Solution

> **Why it matters:**  
Most apps overlook the hormonal changes that affect women’s fitness and nutrition needs across their cycle, leaving users with generic advice.

**CycleSyncAI** bridges this gap by combining Apple HealthKit data with Sonar Pro’s LLM to generate **adaptive, cycle-aware recommendations** for better health outcomes.

---

## Features

- ✅ **Personalized diet & workout suggestions** per cycle phase
- 🔄 Syncs with Apple HealthKit for real-time cycle tracking
- 👤 User profile inputs for advanced personalization (age, goals, restrictions, etc.)
- 🛒 **Auto-generated daily grocery list**
- 🎨 Smooth, modern UI with gradients and subtle animations
- 💬 **Motivational AI feedback** tailored to user preferences
- 🔒 Local data storage and private processing

---

## Prerequisites

- A macOS device with Xcode installed  
- An iOS device (for HealthKit testing)  
- Sonar Pro API access key from Perplexity

---

## Motivation

> “I wanted a tailored regime for myself and couldn’t find it all in one place.”

**CycleSyncAI** was born from the need for a science-backed, easy-to-use app that adapts wellness guidance to women’s natural hormonal rhythms, something missing in most mainstream fitness and nutrition platforms.
